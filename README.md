Here is a concise and clear project description you can use for your GitHub account to describe your Perplexity AI clone built with Flutter and Python:

---

This project is a **Perplexity AI clone** â€” an AI-powered search engine that lets users ask questions and receive well-sourced, AI-generated answers based on real-time online data.

- **Frontend:** Built with Flutter for a smooth, cross-platform user interface.
- **Backend:** Developed using Python with FastAPI to handle API requests efficiently.
- **Data Retrieval:** Utilizes the Gemini API along with other APIs such as Tavily and Transformers to search, sort, and fetch relevant data dynamically.
- **Features:** Combines real-time web search with large language model (LLM) responses to deliver concise, context-aware answers similar to Perplexity AI.
- **Architecture:** The Flutter frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend via REST and WebSocket connections for live chat interactions.
  
This project serves as a solid foundation for building advanced AI-powered applications that integrate multiple APIs and modern frameworks to replicate the functionality of sophisticated AI search engines.
